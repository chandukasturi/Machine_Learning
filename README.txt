hw1_report: This file consists of the entire summarization of the results acquired by the above python codes.


Execution of the above files 

1. You will need to install any latest version Python-3 

2. You will need Anaconda to execute the above submitted python code.Anconda is required as it installs all the necessary packages for importing such as numpy,random...etc

3. After installing anaconda use -pip install notebook command to install jupyter notebook 

4. Open jupyter notebook kernel by typing a command in the anaconda prompt 
	$jupyter notebook -- command to open jupyter notebook
5. Open the files in jupyter notebook by selecting the open file option in the jupyter notebook

6. Run the files in individual kernels or files.

or you can change the directory to the destination folder and enter jupyter notebook command to open the files in jupyter notebook
